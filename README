Note about this github repo (olof/pisg)
---------------------------------------
This is an unofficial pisg repo, with various patches. Please do
not bother upstream if this doesn't work :-). (Feel free to open
issues here though!)

 * The branch "upstream" points to the current HEAD of upstream's master
 * The branch "integration" has all my patches cherry-picked

Currently, the following changes has been applied:

 * Most referenced domains (similar to most referenced URLs)
 * Most lollers (toplist of people saying lol)
 * Some small bug fixes

PS. Upstream's README is (as it has always been) available in
pisg/README.
